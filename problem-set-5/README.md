# Problem set 5
Website made for problem set 5 of Harvard CS50.




### Tea Store Site

Site will be designed for an online tea store using Html, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap.

Use:

```
using the cs50 ide (need check50 installed)
```

Then run on the terminal command line

```
"http-server" while in the homepage directory
```
Then in the opened window

```
click on any of the html files (home page is index.html but you can get to all of the html pages from one another)
```









This is some pretty basic stuff but doing for CS50
