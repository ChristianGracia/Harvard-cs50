# Problem set 5
Website made for problem set 5 of Harvard CS50.




### Tea Store Site

Site will be designed for an online tea store using Html, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap.

If using CS50 ide, type in:

```
"http-server" while in the homepage directory on the terminal command line
```
Then in the opened window

```
click on any of the html files (home page is index.html but you can get to all of the html pages from one another)
```
If using other ide:

```
just preview file :)
```











This is some pretty basic stuff but doing for CS50
